                #4  Simmer 2 cups of heavy cream into a pot and let simmer. while the cream is simmering, separate 5 egg yolks from their shells and mix half a cup of sugar in with them. Once the pot has been brought to a simmer, kill the heat and wait for around fifteen minutes or until the liquid has mostly cooled. Then add the eggs and the root beer flavoring. Pour this liquid into ramekins and put those ramekins in a casarole dish filled around a third of the way with hot water. then bake in the oven for 40ish minutes. then let cool overnight. you can then top with sugar and torch.

                #5  Into a large wok cook some choped up tofu or chicken. Then add some fish sauce and chopped up peanuts. cook on high for around 30 minutes and then add your bean sprouts. The final and most important part of this recipe is the US Tax forms. Add 5 lbs of fresh, shredded, US Tax forms.
